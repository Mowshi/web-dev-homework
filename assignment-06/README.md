1: The most common form I see on the web is when making an online purchase, the site will ask for
my credit card information and address.
2:Text is used when the site needs detailed information from the user where a yes or no or true or false
statement is not enough so text must be typed out. We see this on applications. Selection occurs when a yes or
no or true or false input is enough and allows the user to check a box or bubble. This is found on many surveys. A button is seen when navigating a site or submitting a document or document. These are seen on just about every single site that has multiple pages.
3: I completed this assignment the way I normally do which is reading the instructions then watching the walkthrough then reading the website then finally attempting the assignment on my own.
