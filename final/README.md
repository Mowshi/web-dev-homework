- 1 I learned that viewing a site on multiple devices in many formats is important
for developing a page for the web. Just because a site looks good on one machine does
not guarantee it will look just as great on another.
- 2 Discovering Google fonts and being able to import them into a style sheet with
a link was revolutionary to me. I had a blast combining fonts with colors to determine
the best visuals for my site.
- 3 My first idea was to make a website for my personal art since that was what my
goal was from the start of the class so I began constructing it and running multiple
design ideas by my friends to see which would be the most pleasing to navigate.
Along the way, I looked though older assignment tutorials as well as guides from
the web on how to build a site.
