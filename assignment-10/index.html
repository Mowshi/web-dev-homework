        <i>“If this rain hits hard there’ll be a river come down through here
        like a train. You thought about that?
        You ain't never been struck by lightnin, said Blevins. You don't know
        what it’s like. You’ll get drowned sittin there. That’s all right.
        I ain't never been drowned before.”</i> (Mccarthy 54)

        The more I read this book, the more I enjoy it. At first I thought the
        unconventional style of writing, with the lack of quotations and run on
        sentences, would be too annoying to read but I have seemed to grow
        numb to it. I think a general word of advice to anyone about to read
        this book: try to ignore the incorrect structure and focus on the story.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, the very short lines of dialogue between the characters
        makes them seem one dimensional. I can gather what role each character
        plays and a little bit of background of each one, but they still all
        feel like pieces of cardboard to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I noticed that Alejandra was the only character in the story that was
        described in great detail. This leads me to believe that she will play
        a huge part in the story not just in being a potential girlfriend to
        John but in a bigger way too. My prediction is Alejandra will need
        assistance from John somehow or the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think Blevins is a symbol of something. I don't think he’s really
        meant to be a main character because of how little the two cushions
        care about him and how he has yet to show back up after they all split.
        I think that Blevins might be a symbol of the two cousin’s past lives
        in America. The fact that they have gotten rid of him shows that they
        have moved on. It makes sense because they both now have jobs and a
        solid place in their new communities as cowboys. John went as far as
        claiming that he and Rawlins were the only ones who traveled into Mexico
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose the line of dialog above for an epigraph because it was
        genuinely funny and made my chuckle as I read it. However, this makes me
        wonder about Mccarthy’s comic relief placement. The situation the three
        riders were in seemed like a serious dilemma, but Mccarthy’s use of
        comic relief made the situation seem like a minor inconvenience on the
        three’s way into Mexico when in reality, it made Blevins lose
        everything, even the clothes on his back. I don't know, maybe i’m just
        over analyzing this one small exchange of words.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope to see more character development later in the story. John has a
        good amount of background to him but his personality comes across as
        super dull based on his lines of dialogue. I feel like he and the other
        characters like Rawlins and Alejandra have explosive personalities but
        have yet to light the fuse.
