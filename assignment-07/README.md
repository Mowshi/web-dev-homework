1: divs exist to group page elements together for better organization, but they do not describe what the
content is inside by themselves. This is where ids and classes come in. A class identifies div groups
that are similar types while ids specifically say what the content is. The span element works similarly to
a div but for inline elements.
2: the alt tags provide a short but detailed description of an image on our site. This helps
screen readers who might be visually impaired gain necessary context.
3: After reading the instructions and watching the walkthrough video, I began typing out my code.
I found myself going back to the website and re-reading the vocabulary often for this assignment
