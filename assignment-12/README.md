- 1 The client needs a website for their landscaping company. They do not know
much about websites so all they asked for was something easy to navigate and
list contact info.
- 2 display blocks can hold items in them. display inline can place items in
position with other margins or borders set in place. display inline block
places items inside a block as the developer sees fit.
- 3 This was another tough one for me. I started by coming up with a client and
finding a decent color pallet for their website, then building off of what I
started last week. I struggled to get some CSS elements to work for me so I
checked the review on the website often.
