      <h2><font color="#911f1f">Why this project?</h2>
      <p>I recently picked up this little hobby of mine where I take Hot Wheels cars and customize</p>
      <p>them. I've found it to be a fun and inexpensive activity to do when board. I have also</P>
      <p>replicated real life cars such as the '95 Miata in this instructable. I am mostly doing</P>
      <p>this all on my own. What I mean by that is there are very few people who customize Hot</p>
      <p>Wheels cars like this, so I thought making an instructable would help "raise awareness"</p>
      <p>to this niche hobby</p>

      <h2>What does it mean for me?</h2>
      <p>As I said, I just want to help make this hobby a bit more mainsteam not only because</p>
      <p>I enjoy it, but also because I think anyone with a limited budjet who enjoys tinkering</p>
      <p>would get a kick out of it.</p>

      <p>This gentleman has made handfuls of neat custom Hot wheels and Matchbox cars. His</p>
      <p>videos are long, but have lots of details about the execution of car customization.</p>
